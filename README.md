# React Native Template

## Quick start

Generate a new React Native(**v0.69.4**) app using the **@ajaysidhu/react-native-template**:

```shell
npx react-native init MyApp --template https://github.com/archimondee/react-native-71-template
```

You might also be prompted to confirm the installation for the packages `react-native` and `husky`. Simply hit `enter` to proceed.

The template will automatically install the `npm` dependencies and the `pods` (if you are on the MacOS).
